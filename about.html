                    <p>
                        My name is Nursyuhada Binti Shamsureli, 
                        usually called Syu in daily basis and only people closestto me called me Adda.
                        I was born on February 2001 which had me to be a Pisces. I do not practice and trust 
                        astrological horoscope in daily life, I just loved to be called a Pisces.
                        Yet still, I could say that I'm emotionally sensitive and prefer calm environtment.
                        I might be soft-hearted where I usually will be the one who make peace if there is any 
                        issues in between. I hate involving in an argument or fight, not even get near to it. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was raised in Semenyih, Selangor for almost 2 decades since I was a 3 years old and will move to my birthplace, 
                        Kuala Kangsar, Perak in about 2 months from now.
                        Growing up here teach me a lot in life. I witnessed everything that happens to me 
                        and my surroundings. I've been in my lowest phase to this very maturation phase. 
                        My childhood phase was hopeless yet I still live it to the fulllest.
                        22 years of living brings me the joy and misery feelings which complete my life
                        as a normal person. There is still win-in-life moment where I proved myself in my PT3 examination result. 
                        I enjoy each episodes of my life and looking forward to sketch new memories with a lot more of achievements.

                        It was a thrilling moment when I get my UPU result since I was the first in my family member
                        who got into university. I'm proudly bring my family name in here with their physical and moral support
                        to further my studies journey. I could not believe I'm in my last semester since we've been struck by the COVID-19 pandemic.
                        I only get to enjoy my life in uni for only 7 month worth of one semester journey. After that,
                        everything turns into chaos and struggles, Online Distance Learning is a total burden to us student
                        physically and mentally.
