                <br>
                <p>
                    My name is Nursyuhada Binti Shamsureli, usually called Syu in general. 
                    Only the person closest to me would call me Adda. I was born on February 2001 
                    which had me to be a Pisces. I did not practice and trust these astrological 
                    horoscope in my daily life, I just loved to be called Pisces. Yet still, 
                    I could say that I am emotionally sensitive and prefer calm envorinment. 
                    I might be soft-hearted where I will not going to be mad for a long time as 
                    I really hate argument. I'm usually the one that would make peace if there 
                    is any issues among people around me.
                    <br>
                    I was raised in Semenyih, Selangor almost 2 decades and 
                    will move to my birthplace in Kuala Kangsar, Perak in about 2 months from now. 
                    Grow up here is teach me so many things in life. I've witnessed everything from 
                    my lower path up until now in my maturation phase. 22 years of living brings all 
                    the joy and misery feelings which hange me who I am now. I learnt from episodes 
                    in my life and looking forward to treasure more in future.

                <p>
                    I am having my last semester of Diploma in Information Management here in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan.
                    It was a thrilling moment when I get my UPU result since I was the first in my family member
                    who got into university. I'm proudly bring my family name in here with their physical and moral support
                    to further my studies journey. I could not believe I'm in my last semester since we've been struck by the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    I only get to enjoy my life in uni for only 7 month worth of one semester journey. After that,
                    everything turns into chaos and struggles, Online Distance Learning is a total burden to us student
                    physically and mentally. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        However, I'm still planning to further my journey to Degree in the same course.
                    I am actually waiting for my Penerapan UITM results which will be announce in March.
                    The intense to finish my study as soon as possible to be able to live my life to the fullest 
                    after were exxagerating.

                    This is by far my closest friends, from primary school to university life. 
                    These are the one who are still having me since day one. Each of them have special spot in my heart 
                    with their presence. I appreciate each of them for staying eventough I did not gave much in our friendship.
                    Few of them have been friend with me for a decade without having any fights or arguments.
                    There are issues, but we solved it in a really mature ways which makes me value them the most in my life.
                    I don't like complicate things in any relation with my life. This is my way of keeping my circle healthy, it is not only beneficial
                    mentally but also emotionally.

                    He is the guy I met on early last year, starting my 2021 with him. He is not my first love,
                    he came unexpectedly and running in my mind. I was in misery and struggling at that time, it then all blown away 
                    after he appeared, I feel like the burden has gone. He brings comfort and warm
                    into myself that no one could give to me. He is my second home, my safest place.

                <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Participating in flood volunteering is my one of an unforgetable experience.
                    It was a grim and bleak situation, but unaffected communities who were able to help 
                    quickly began organising fundraisers and volunteer efforts to relieve the floods' impact.
                    Properties and vehicles were wrecked, people were stranded, missing, found deceased 
                    and thousands of people are displaced.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I am not equipped to help with more advanced flood relief efforts as how the NGO do,
                    what  I were able to instead offer was manpower. Since I'm currently in college here in Rembau,
                    I decided to join my batchmates and Briged Sukarelawan under UiTM's sueprvision to affected area 
                    around Negeri Sembilan to help out the victims clean their house, deliver food aid and also giving them moral support
                    since they are losing so much due to the incident.

                <h2>Modelling</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This is actually my first out-of-comfort-zone experience on 2019. I was called by my mom's
                    superior to be a model for her event which I had to help because of my mom.
                    It was a brittle moment ever I would say. Had to learn those modelling things in just 2 days,
                    yet I still made it eventhough I could not even feel myself back then. But,
                    to be in the runway would be my last thing to do in my life.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modelling is totally not my thing, I would rather come as a guest
                    rather to be in a runway and be attentive in crowds. That is because
                    of my social anxiety that I have developed since I was in high school.
                    Still, this is my first and last experience as a model which gaves me apprehension.
                    It was a total fortune back then, the event was held privately in a hotel and only for small
                    invitation which were surely be considerated.
