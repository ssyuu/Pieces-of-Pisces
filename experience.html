                <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Participating in flood volunteering is my one of an unforgetable experience.
                    It was a grim and bleak situation, but unaffected communities who were able to help 
                    quickly began organising fundraisers and volunteer efforts to relieve the floods' impact.
                    Properties and vehicles were wrecked, people were stranded, missing, found deceased 
                    and thousands of people are displaced.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I am not equipped to help with more advanced flood relief efforts as how the NGO do,
                    what  I were able to instead offer was manpower. Since I'm currently in college here in Rembau,
                    I decided to join my batchmates and Briged Sukarelawan under UiTM's sueprvision to affected area 
                    around Negeri Sembilan to help out the victims clean their house, deliver food aid and also giving them moral support
                    since they are losing so much due to the incident.

                <h2>Modelling</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This is actually my first out-of-comfort-zone experience on 2019. I was called by my mom's
                    superior to be a model for her event which I had to help because of my mom.
                    It was a brittle moment ever I would say. Had to learn those modelling things in just 2 days,
                    yet I still made it eventhough I could not even feel myself back then. But,
                    to be in the runway would be my last thing to do in my life.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Modelling is totally not my thing, I would rather come as a guest
                    rather to be in a runway and be attentive in crowds. That is because
                    of my social anxiety that I have developed since I was in high school.
                    Still, this is my first and last experience as a model which gaves me apprehension.
                    It was a total fortune back then, the event was held privately in a hotel and only for small
                    invitation which were surely be considerated.
